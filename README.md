## Learning Roadmap
To become a cloud engineer, it’s essential to build a strong foundation and progressively tackle more advanced topics. Below is a recommended learning path with key areas you should master:

### 1. Cloud Fundamentals
   - What is cloud computing?
   - Service models: IaaS, PaaS, SaaS
   - Deployment models: Public, private, hybrid
   - Cloud benefits and challenges

### 2. Major Cloud Providers
   - Overview of AWS, Azure, Google Cloud
   - Core services comparison
   - Choosing the right provider for different use cases

### 3. Compute Services
   - Virtual machines (e.g., AWS EC2, Azure VMs)
   - Containers (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes)
   - Serverless computing (e.g., AWS Lambda, Azure Functions)

### 4. Storage and Databases
   - Object storage (e.g., AWS S3, Azure Blob)
   - Block and file storage
   - Relational and NoSQL databases (e.g., AWS RDS, DynamoDB)

### 5. Networking
   - Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) and subnets
   - Load balancing and traffic management
   - Network security (e.g., firewalls, security groups)

### 6. Security and Identity
   - Identity and Access Management (IAM)
   - Encryption and key management
   - Compliance and governance

### 7. Monitoring and Management
   - Logging and monitoring tools (e.g., AWS CloudWatch, Azure Monitor)
   - Cost management and optimization
   - Resource tagging and organization

### 8. Automation and Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
   - Tools like Terraform, AWS CloudFormation, ARM templates
   - Writing and managing infrastructure code
   - Version control for IaC

### 9. DevOps Practices
   - CI/CD pipelines (e.g., Jenkins, GitHub Actions)
   - Collaboration and version control (e.g., Git)
   - Automated testing and deployment strategies

### 10. Advanced Topics
   - Big data processing (e.g., AWS EMR, Azure HDInsight)
   - AI/ML in the cloud (e.g., AWS SageMaker, Google AI Platform)
   - Multi-cloud and hybrid cloud strategies

For each of these areas, you’ll find tutorials, guides, and links to hands-on projects within the repository’s folders.
